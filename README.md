# C-final-project
The project gets in the command line files it wants the program to run. The program first preprocessor the file, and spreads the macros. Next, it runs the first go on the code - it builds a symbols table of all the labels, starts to build the machine code of registers and numbers, and checks the validity of the code. Finally, it runs the second go that completes the machine code of the labels and produces three output files - object that contains the machine code of instructions and data, ext file that contains each appearance of an external label, and entry label that contains each line that is defined as entry.
